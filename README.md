A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running as Mobile Web App

To run the app in a mobile browser during development:

```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

To build a production-optimized web bundle (recommended for deploying to a static host):

```powershell
flutter build web --web-renderer html
```

Serve the resulting `build/web` directory from any static web host. For local testing you can use `python -m http.server` from inside `build/web` or `npx serve .`.
